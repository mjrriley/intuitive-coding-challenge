# Code Challenge

This my (Matthew Riley) solution to the coding challenge.

## Build

To build the project:
    make

Build can be cleaned by running:
    make clean

## PEP 8 Checker

To verify code is PEP 8 compliant:
    make style

## Unit Test

To run tests:
    make test

I was unable to create unit tests for client.py in time.

## Testing Responsiveness

To verify that status request were responsive and not blocking,
I created client.py and server.py to communication with each other.
By running server.py first and then client.py, you will see the
server will write parameters without block status requests.
